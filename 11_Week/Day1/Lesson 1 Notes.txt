Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines

Classification - categorizing somethign according to shared qualities or characteristics

logist regression

1 preprocess
2 train
3 validate
4 predict

sklearn.datasets package can generate dummy data

from sklearn.dataset import make_blobs

X, y = make_blobs(centers=2, random_state=42)

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split - splits data into train and test
stratify = y is how many categories you want
random_state default is none. Define a number 

classifier.score = closer to 1 is better

Confusion Matrix

True/ False Positive/ Negative
True or False is model prediction accuracy
Positive/ Negative if the person is positive or negative for a medical test (i.e. diabetes)

False negatives are bad - the person doesn't know they are in a meidcal condition!

Accruacy - correct predicted (true positive and true negative) over entire dataset
Precision - True Positive (true positive / (true positive + false positive)
Recall - true positive / (true positive + false negative)
