Sentimental ANalysis

study of peopples opinions emotions

What kind of sentiments could be analysed?
Polarity - Positive, neutral and negative
Emotions - angry, happy, ssad
Intentions - what are people going to do
Certainty on Economy - positive, negatvie and neutral (realtime economic indicators by RBA)


How to do it?

Ruled-Based Analysis - sentiment analysis based on rules crafted using NLP techniques such as stemming, tokenization, part of speech tagging and parsing

You define two lists of polarized words - for example: positive and negative works
Count the number of positive words
Count the number of negative words

more positive words than positive (vice versa)

Supervised machine learning

Challenges:
multilingual sentiment anlaysis is complex
people express openiong in complex ways
in opnion texts, leixcal content alone can be misleading
voice tone is not considered


Term Relevance
term relevance is quite important on sentimental anlysis since leads to a better undestaning of human speech

Corpus - large structured and organized collection of text documents that normally verses on a specific matter

TF-IDF
Term frequency and inverse document frequency
weighting factor measure ow important a word is to a document in a collection of documents or corpus
TF a count of the word in a document
IDF - how rare is my word in the document set - closer it is to 0, the more common it is
TF drives up the score, but IDF will bring it down if the word occurs in all or many documents

TF can be a measure of relevant

A Bag of Words is basically a text converted into a bag of words - grammar and word order is disregarded


Vectorizer - maps the word to a number
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidVectorizer

Vader Sentiment - score the sentiment poloarity of human speech as positive neutral or negative based on a set of rules and a lexicon. Gives a number to say how positive or negaive it is basede on a scale
1 = positive / -1 is negative
0 is neutral
You can get compound score too - summation of all lexicon ratings
