* *Name of company*

Coinsquare

* *When was the company incorporated?*

Coinsquare was started in 2014.

* *Who are the founders of the company?*

The founder of Coinsquare is Virgile Rostand. Cole Diamond became a co-founder at a later stage by investing and joining Coinsquare in 2016.

* *How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?*

Virgile Rostand (Rostand) was a mathemetician with a Master of Sciene in Applied Mathematics from Universite Laval and Master in Mathematical Finance from the University fo Toronto. He completed his mentioned studies in 2004.

As he progressed through his varied career which included stints in academics, financial engineer, consultantancy and quantitative development, Rostand started to observe and become aware of the growing trend of cryptocurrency. In 2014, his curiosuity and enthuisasm led him to create and Coinsquare and he officially started building the platform we know today.


* *How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?*

Throughout 2017-2018, Coinsquare went through a round of investment injection which included a $30m USD financing round in Feb2018 and $10.5m USD in Series A investment. By mid 2018, Coinsquare raised approximately $47.3m USD lifting the equity valuation at that point in time to $430m USD.

Recently, 12Feb21, Coinsquare announched that Mogomoney has increased their stake to 40% of Coinsquare with a $56.4m USD investment.


## Business Activities:

* *What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?*

The financial problem Coinsquare is trying to solve is to make cryptocurrency easily accessible, secure and easy to use. They created the Coinsquare platform/ exchange to solve this problem.

* *Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?*

The company has designed their platform to be used by beginner cryptocurrency traders to your high net worth investors. The overall global cryptocurrency market size was at $754m USD in 2019 and is projected to reach $1.758m by 2027.

* *What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)*

Whilst Coinsquare's competitors offer similar products, where Coinsquare excels is the customer experience and making the cryptocurrency experience easy for it's users. In addition, the platform has yet to be hacked.

* *Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?*

First and foremost, Coinsquare lives and breaths in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space so this is the predominat technology it utilises. It would have a cloud based infrastucture to build it's user layer and store information. They utilise cold storage methoed to contrl and store the coins of it's users. They use two factor authentication and SSL communications to provide further security to their users.


## Landscape:

* *What domain of the financial industry is the company in?*

Blockchain and Cryptocurrency - specifically cryptocurrency.

* *What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?*

The cryptocurrency has been rapidly evolving over the past 10 yaers. Since the first bitcoin purchase in 2010, it has evolved from something that only few people know about to know a commonly traded e-currency by both day traders and sophisticated investors. Whilst Bitcoin was the original cryptocurrency that started this technology, various other cryptocurrencies have also been created such as Ethereum, Litecoin, Tron and plenty more (even humourously named ones such as Dogecoin).

This domain has also seen the evolution of smart contracts to utilise the security of blockchain to deliver contracts. The most relevant trend for the purposes of looking at Coinsquare is the wave of platforms that has been created over the past 10 years such as Coinsquare to give users the power to transact in the cryptocurrency world.

* *What are the other major companies in this domain?*

    * Coinbase
    * Binance
    * Bybit
    * Etoro
    * FTX
    * Kraken
    * Crypto
    * Kucoin
    * Prime XBT
    * Phemex
    * and plenty more

## Results

* *What has been the business impact of this company so far?*

As Coinsquare is not a listed business, their financials are not easily accessible. With this being said, we know that their revenue is growing with estimated annual revenue of $14m and trading volume of $525m in January 2021. With the recent Mogo additional investment in Coinsquare, the valuation of the pre-money valuation of Coinsquare ranges from $250-350m.

* *What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?*

One key measure of success of a cryptocurrency platform is the trading volume and whilst Coinsquare is growing, it still lags key players such as Binance ($27bn in 24 hours), Coinbase Pro ($5bn in 24 hours) and Kraken ($2b in 24 hours).

* *How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?*

The company isn't performing well mid last year, Coinsquare was accused of operating a wash-trading scheme which violated secruities law. Wash Trading is when they internally execute large zero-fee market trades within their orders to give the apperance of large trading activity. It is reported taht 90% of Coinsquare's volume was artifically created. The impact of this was that key Coinsquare execs including the founder Rostand himself was forced to resign and pay penalties ($1m was paid by Diamond). Further, they were banned from being directors of a companies of "market participants" for one to three years.

The reputation impact caused from this has stunted Coinsquares growth and trading volume has seen a decline.


## Recommendations

* *If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?*

Ignoring the reputational risk and trust that users may not have for Coinsquare, I would suggest the business continue to focus on building the customer experience and strengthening this pillar of difference for them. 

* *Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?*

When reviewing the various cryptocurrency platforms, the underlying technology of the exchange is similar. One key consideration for users when deciding which platform to utilise is how easy is it to pick up and use. By furthering strengthening this, Coinsquare can excel to be the leading market player in an easy to use cryptocurrency platform.

* *What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?*

One potential technology is utilising AI to speed up the registration and verification process. In addition, using AI, to start providing advise on what and when to trade on their platform.

* *Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?*

The AI technology mentioned is appropriate for the solution as the data is there for them to use and some of the mentioned is alredy being implemented in other platforms.
